#### Minimum Temperature
The coldest months are March and February, with temperatures consistently below -80°C.
August sees the warmest minimum temperature at -68.38°C, though it is still very cold.
The transition from winter to spring is marked by a gradual increase in minimum temperatures, but temperatures remain quite low, especially in March and April.
As the year progresses, the temperatures become gradually warmer from winter (January) to summer (August), but still remain very cold compared to most regions.
The fall months show a minor decrease in temperatures, but they don't dip as low as the coldest winter months.
Conclusion:
The minimum temperatures show a classic seasonal pattern, where temperatures are at their lowest in the winter and gradually warm up in the summer months before cooling down again in fall. The coldest periods occur in early spring and late winter, while late summer (August) sees the highest minimum temperatures, albeit still below freezing. These temperature trends are typical for regions with harsh winters and cooler summers.


#### Atmospheric Pressure
The highest average pressure occurs in September (913.31 hPa), which is typically a transitional period between summer and fall.
The lowest average pressure is observed in June (745.05 hPa), reflecting the more volatile weather conditions associated with the warmer months.
The spring months (April and May) show a notable drop in pressure, suggesting the dominance of low-pressure systems as the weather warms up.
There is a gradual increase in pressure during the fall months, followed by a slight decrease toward the end of the year.
Conclusion:
The average atmospheric pressure exhibits typical seasonal patterns, with higher pressure in the fall and winter months and lower pressure in the spring and summer. These patterns are likely tied to the Earth's axial tilt and the associated shifts in temperature and weather systems, which influence air density and pressure.

#### Year Length

The Martian year is the length of time it takes Mars to orbit the Sun, which is longer than Earth's year because Mars is farther from the Sun. The Martian year is approximately 687 Earth days long. This is about 1.88 Earth years.

Explanation:
Earth year: 365.25 days (on average)
Martian year: 687 Earth days
This difference in the length of the year arises from Mars having a larger orbit and taking more time to complete one revolution around the Sun.

Calculation of Sols in a Martian Year:
Since a Martian day (a sol) is slightly longer than an Earth day (about 24 hours and 39 minutes), there are roughly 669 sols in one Martian year. You can calculate it more precisely as follows:

1 Earth year ≈ 365.25 days
1 Martian day (sol) ≈ 24 hours 39 minutes ≈ 1.027 Earth days
Thus, a Martian year is approximately:

Key Points:
The Martian year is about 687 Earth days, or about 669 sols.
It takes 1.88 Earth years for Mars to complete one orbit around the Sun.
This extended orbit results in seasonal changes on Mars, but the seasons themselves are much longer than Earth's, with each season lasting around 669 sols / 4 ≈ 167 sols, or about 334 Earth days.
